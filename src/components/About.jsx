          In growing churches and ministries, keeping track of people isn’t just
          about numbers — it’s about care, connection, and accountability. This
          app was created to solve a simple but vital need: To make attendance
          tracking easier, faster, and more organized — whether for Sunday
          services, special programs, departments, or global groups. We saw how
          manual registrations, scattered data, and delays in reporting often
          made follow-up difficult and slowed down leadership decisions. So we
